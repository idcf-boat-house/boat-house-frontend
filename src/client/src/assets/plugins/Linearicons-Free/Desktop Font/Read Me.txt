In this folder, you can find the Linearicons-Free font in TTF format. You can install this font so that you can use it in desktop applications.

Open "Reference.html" to see a list of the icons available in this font. The text box located to the bottom right of each icon contains a character (which may be invisible). You can copy and use this character in any desktop application that allows entering text and choosing a custom font to display it. You may also type or copy the text in the "liga" field if the environment in which you're using the font supports ligatures.

To get crisp results, use font sizes that are a multiple of 20px.

It is not recommended to use this font on the web because it contains ligatuers and extra glyphs such as Latin letters. Refer to the "Web-Font" folder to find a font suitable for web. To make a custom font with only the glyphs that you need, use the IcoMoon app (https://icomoon.io/app).
